## Waiting on you

**T3. Apply the server-checked fights migration** · Decide · Server · asked 2026-10-03
- The fight_sessions migration (single-use seed, transcript, server replay) is written and the client is ready. Nothing changes until it is applied.
  - Say "apply it" and I run supabase/migrations/20261003_fight_sessions.sql
  - Wait
- **Default:** Wait (local seeds keep working)

**D17. Sound direction and sourcing** · Decide · Sound · asked 2026-10-03
- Overall feel for the cue sheet (sfx-cue-sheet.md), and whether to use CC0 packs or your own recordings. Real samples will beat more synthesis; I can't download them from here.
  - A. Cosy and organic
  - B. Chiptune
  - C. Mixed (organic world, chiptune UI)
  - Drop CC0 files (Kenney Impact/Casino) into audio/
  - Send your own files
- **Default:** C, CC0 when files arrive

**D18. Play Maps 1–4 and say how difficulty and rewards feel** · Feedback · Balance · asked 2026-10-03
- Map 1 is an on-ramp; Maps 1–2 have reward cards; Map 2 retuned. Note: since 2026-10-08 Conquest fights default to Open mode (no collapsing), which changes how the AI and positions play, so the old difficulty numbers need a re-check.
- **Default:** I re-simulate win rates under Open mode next

**L1. Which beasts the Hummingbirds befriend; proposed card renames** · Decide · Lore · asked 2026-10-06
- Open questions from lore-bible.md. Dogs and cats are settled (see L2).
- **Default:** Keep current names

**I1. Native-speaker review for Tagalog, Tamil, Japanese and Korean** · Decide · Languages · asked 2026-10-06
- Machine-quality translations ship now (including card names). A native pass would catch tone and idiom.
  - Find reviewers
  - Ship as is
- **Default:** Ship as is

**I2. Translate text that contains numbers** · Decide · Languages · asked 2026-10-08
- Lines like "3 cards", "Pack 2 of 10", "N new cards!" stay English because the translator matches whole strings. Fix: number-aware templates for each language.
  - Approve the template change
  - Leave English
- **Default:** Approve

**H1. Hero levelling pace, stat prices, and Materia socketing (v2)** · Feedback · Hero · asked 2026-10-06
- Play a few fights with a Hero and say how it feels; do you want Materia socketing next?

**H2. The 3-part Hero XP bar (feedback item 17)** · Decide · Hero · asked 2026-10-08
- How the three XP bars should split (battle XP, Materia XP, ...?) — needs your picture of it.

**E1. A free pack for guests before sign-in** · Decide · Economy · asked 2026-10-08
- Let a guest open one Sprout Pouch before asking them to sign in.
  - Yes
  - No
- **Default:** Yes

**E2. Disenchant values (Magic Dust per extra copy)** · Confirm · Economy · asked 2026-10-08
- Built with: Common 5, Uncommon 8, Rare 15, Very Rare 20, Super Rare 30, Epic 40, Heroic 50, Unique 60, Legendary 100, Mythic 150, Ancient 200. Never Base/Quest/levelled/foil/Shiny; keeps one copy.
  - Keep
  - Change the numbers
- **Default:** Keep

**C1. Which cards get the six new finishes** · Decide · Cards · asked 2026-10-08
- Hex, Etched, Ice, Gold leaf, Reverse and Prism are built (Effects Lab → Card treatment centre). Who gets them: rarities, events, pack tiers, prestige?

**G1. Combo counter** · Decide · Battle · asked 2026-10-07
- A counter for chains of triggered abilities in one round, with escalating sound/visuals.
  - Build it
  - Skip

**G2. Siding with Otters or Hummingbirds (proposal)** · Decide · Lore · asked 2026-10-08
- See siding-proposal-2026-10-08.md: a standing meter moved by dialogue choices and which side's fights you take, unlocking side-specific rewards, titles and a late-game fork.
  - Approve as written
  - Change parts
  - Not yet

**T1. Catch-up mechanics** · Discuss · Design · asked 2026-10-03
- Rested XP, a weekly comeback quest tier, cheaper early Conquest once you've cleared further, a gentler curve.

**T2. Replays** · Discuss · Design · asked 2026-10-03
- Watch-only or re-fight this deck? Share links? How many to keep?

**N1. The Nest repeats the Codex** · Discuss · Design · asked 2026-10-08
- You noted the Nest overlaps the Codex. Kept for now. Ideas when you're ready: the Nest as your trophy shelf (Shinies, foils, prestige), or merge it into Codex as an Owned filter.
- **Default:** Keep for now

**S1. Apply the admin player list function** · Decide · Server · asked 2026-10-08
- The Admin → Players portal reads one admin-only, read-only database function (admin_list_players: profiles, levels, currencies, cards, matches; no emails). Written in supabase/proposed/20261008_admin_list_players.sql. Applying it (and the panel that reads it, already drafted) was held for your OK.
  - Say "apply it" (admin list)
  - Wait
- **Default:** Apply

**S2. Anti-cheat tier 1** · Decide · Security · asked 2026-10-08
- Players can currently edit their own rating and currencies from the browser console. Tier 1 makes rating read-only and refuses any single write that adds more than 2,000 Maple / 200 Gold Leaves. supabase/proposed/20261008_anticheat_tier1.sql.
  - Apply tier 1
  - Change the caps
  - Wait
- **Default:** Apply tier 1

**S3. Turn on leaked-password protection** · Do · Security · asked 2026-10-08
- Supabase dashboard → Auth → Passwords → leaked password protection. Free, one click, needs your login.
  - Done
  - Skip
- **Default:** Done

**S4. SonarCloud as well as CodeQL?** · Decide · Security · asked 2026-10-08
- CodeQL now scans every push (free, GitHub → Security). SonarCloud adds code-quality and duplication reports; it needs you to sign in at sonarcloud.io and add a token.
  - Add SonarCloud
  - CodeQL is enough
- **Default:** CodeQL is enough

**A1. API keys + monthly caps for GPT Image and fal/Kling** · Do · Art · asked 2026-10-08
- Create the keys yourself, keep them as local environment variables (never in the repo), set a monthly cap in each dashboard. Nothing is bought without your OK. See asset-pipeline-action-items.md.
  - Done
  - Not yet
- **Default:** Not yet

**A2. Train a Bramblewood pixel LoRA?** · Decide · Art · asked 2026-10-08
- FLUX.2 [dev] trained on ~30 of our PixelLab cards (~$6.40 per 1,000 steps on fal), for Maps 9–10 cards and Home sprites while PixelLab is capped.
  - Yes, test on 10 cards
  - Not yet
- **Default:** Yes, test on 10 cards

**A3. 30 s trailer from Kling clips** · Decide · Marketing · asked 2026-10-08
- 5–6 Kling 3.0 image-to-video clips (splash crowd, pack tear, Shiny reveal, Ember Chipmunk fire, castle fall) cut with gameplay capture.
  - Go
  - Later
- **Default:** Later

**F3. Enchant and Refine numbers** · Confirm · Cards · asked 2026-10-08
- Enchant: Ember +1⚔ (scorch), Stone +3❤, Tide +2❤, Grove +1⚔+1❤. Refine costs from 40✨+100🍁 (Foil) up to 200✨+450🍁+10🍂 (Gold leaf). Tide is currently a weaker Stone; give it something of its own?
  - Keep
  - Retune
- **Default:** Keep

**C2. Lock the battle type in the skirmish editor?** · Clarify · Conquest · asked 2026-10-09
- You said 'You CANNOT change the battle type once it's been set in the skirmish editor'. In a local test the change saved fine. Is that a bug you hit (it reverted?), or a request to lock the field after the first save?
  - It's a bug: it reverts
  - Lock it after the first save

**C3. Victory shift and the castle's white gradient** · Clarify · Battle · asked 2026-10-09
- Couldn't reproduce either. Which cards move at the end of a fight, and when? Where does the white gradient on the castle show (fight, map, results)? A screenshot would settle both.

**E9. What do Krooni 👑 buy?** · Decide · Economy · asked 2026-10-09
- The Golden case gives 3 Krooni. Nothing spends them yet, and they're kept on this device only (no database column). Ideas: cosmetic finishes, a Krooni-only pack, or Hero rarity boosts.
  - Cosmetics
  - A Krooni pack
  - Hero boosts
  - Decide later
- **Default:** Decide later

**E10. Promotion cost and level** · Decide · Economy · asked 2026-10-09
- Worker Ant promotes at Lv 3 for 60 Maple Leaves + 20 Dust. The ant goes back to Lv 0, so it can be promoted again into the other choices. Ant Warrior uses the Soldier Ant's art for now.
  - Keep
  - Higher level (5)
  - Free promotion, keep the level
- **Default:** Keep

**E11. Nurse master bonus** · Decide · Economy · asked 2026-10-09
- The Nest Nurse (a Unique+ card or the Wandering Traveller) is in, but what it does is still open. Ideas: eggs hatch 25% faster; a small chance a hatch comes out Shiny.
  - Faster hatching
  - Shiny chance
  - Both
- **Default:** Faster hatching

**D19. Archetypes: which to build first** · Decide · Design · asked 2026-10-09
- archetypes-design-2026-10-09.md has 10 archetypes plus the Elder / Outer / Forgotten trio. Suggested order: an active Exile zone, Swarm, Tide, Devilry circles, Elder Ones, then Evolution ride. Each archetype lists its open questions.
  - Follow the suggested order
  - Start with Evolution
  - Start with the trio
- **Default:** Follow the suggested order

**B4. Cards that cost 3+ Lumber don't pay off** · Decide · Balance · asked 2026-10-09
- Cards costing 3+ Lumber (all five dragons included) score ~38% in simulation. 2026-10-09, taking the default on 'continue': all 30 got an arrival effect (dragons breathe 4 on every enemy; brutes hit the enemy opposite for 2× their cost; Elder Willow, Elderhorn Monarch and Riverworks Bastion refund 2 Lumber; the slow small ones delay the enemy opposite by 2 Wait). It didn't move them: the real cause is that Lumber only comes from discarding cards, so a 4-cost card costs five cards in all. Tested a passive income with the CPU saving properly: +1 Lumber every 2 rounds gives cost-2 cards 75%, cost-3+ 51%, dragons 60% (free cards fall to ~24%, as cheap cards should); every round is too much (dragons 96%); every 3 rounds is too little (45%).
  - +1 Lumber every 2 rounds (core rules change)
  - +1 every 3 rounds
  - Keep discard-only Lumber; make big cards cheaper
  - Leave as is
- **Default:** +1 Lumber every 2 rounds (core rules change)

## Decided

**E3. Shiny look** · Decide · Cards · asked 2026-10-08 · decided 2026-10-08
- **Outcome:** Hue shift, not a foil: the art is recoloured by a fixed per-card hue (90–270°), soft white glow, twinkling ✦. Prism stays a foil treatment.

**E4. Pack set discounts** · Decide · Economy · asked 2026-10-08 · decided 2026-10-08
- **Outcome:** Revised 2026-10-08: 1/10/25/50/100 packs = 0/5/6/7/7.5% off. Built.

**G3. Skirmish default mode** · Decide · Battle · asked 2026-10-08 · decided 2026-10-08

**L2. Dogs and cats** · Decide · Lore · asked 2026-10-06 · decided 2026-10-08

**D15. PixelLab credits** · Decide · Art · asked 2026-10-03 · decided 2026-10-03

**T4. Currencies and Materia** · Decide · Economy · asked 2026-10-03 · decided 2026-10-03
- **Outcome:** Many currencies are fine as long as each shows only where it matters.

**T8. Farms and potions** · Decide · Design · asked 2026-10-03 · decided 2026-10-03
- **Outcome:** Approved as sketched: real-time plots, PvE-only potions, sellable once trades are server-side.

**T9. Sound sourcing plan** · Decide · Sound · asked 2026-10-03 · decided 2026-10-03
- **Outcome:** CC0 first (Kenney, OpenGameArt, Freesound) plus our own jsfxr, with audio/ and CREDITS.md.

**T7. Effects picks** · Decide · Effects · asked 2026-10-03 · decided 2026-10-03

- **Outcome:** Cancelled.

**D12. Passwords** · Decide · Accounts · asked 2026-10-03 · decided 2026-10-03

**D16. UI/UX review** · Decide · UI · asked 2026-10-03 · decided 2026-10-03
- **Outcome:** Ongoing Polish track.

**D10. Native builds** · Decide · Platform · asked 2026-10-02 · decided 2026-10-03
- **Outcome:** Not yet.

**D1. Header and Home** · Decide · UI · asked 2026-10-02 · decided 2026-10-03
- **Outcome:** Built: Play as hero, 2×2 grid, Quests and Community extras.

**D7. Raid damage** · Decide · Raids · asked 2026-10-02 · decided 2026-10-03
- **Outcome:** Core lock global; equal base + tiers; Maple Leaves; overflow damage counts.

**D8. Trench** · Decide · Raids · asked 2026-10-02 · decided 2026-10-03
- **Outcome:** Built: you play your row; allies CPU; telegraphed columns.

**E7. Pack contents and foil odds** · Decide · Economy · asked 2026-10-08 · decided 2026-10-08
- **Outcome:** Pack editor (Admin): per pack price, size, pool, rarity weights, foil chance per card, guaranteed foil, and finish weights (By rarity 60, Prism 9, Hex 8, Etched 7, Ice 7, Reverse 6, Gold 3). Sprout Pouch 4% foil per card, Acorn Chest 8%, Golden Bramble Case 12% with one guaranteed. A card's From picks its pack pool. Publishes live as __cfg:shop-packs.

**E8. Over-size decks and the main deck** · Decide · Decks · asked 2026-10-08 · decided 2026-10-08
- **Outcome:** Decks can hold any number of cards while building (calm 'N over' note, no red shake). ★ Main deck is chosen explicitly and is what you play with; only a 20-card main deck can be played.

**F1. Upgrade / Refine / Enchant** · Decide · Cards · asked 2026-10-08 · decided 2026-10-08
- **Outcome:** Forge has three tabs. Upgrade = level 1–10 then Prestige. Refine = your best copy up the finish ladder Plain → Foil → Hex → Etched → Cracked ice → Reverse → Prism → Gold leaf (costs rise; Prism/Gold need Gold Leaves); never makes Shiny. Enchant = socket one Materia (Ember +1⚔ and scorching hits, Stone +3❤, Tide +2❤, Grove +1⚔+1❤); crystals are the player's now, crafted from Dust without a Hero.

**F2. Shiny in battle** · Decide · Cards · asked 2026-10-08 · decided 2026-10-08
- **Outcome:** Shiny is rolled in the one grant function, so any card received can be Shiny. A card you own a Shiny copy of is Shiny in your hand and on the board, and units it spawns are Shiny too.

**B1. Open-mode difficulty tweaks** · Decide · Balance · asked 2026-10-08 · decided 2026-10-09
- Re-simulated under Open fights (difficulty-open-mode-2026-10-08.md): Maps 1–4 got easier; Map 3's first two skirmishes (16 HP) are now easier than Map 2's; the Frost Yeti King (130 HP) is a 0% wall. Proposed: Badger Warband and Quill Line to ~22 HP; Yeti King to ~90 HP or make its fight Gravity (collapsing) as a special. Superseded if B2 retunes all maps.
  - Apply both
  - Only Map 3
  - Only Yeti King
  - Leave as is
- **Default:** Apply both
- **Outcome:** Superseded by B2's full retune.

**B2. Skirmish balance audit proposals** · Decide · Balance · asked 2026-10-09 · decided 2026-10-09
- skirmish-balance-audit-2026-10-08.md proposed HP changes on 72 nodes and 33 deck swaps. It was measured before today's CPU fix (the enemy now plays its Lumber cards), so its numbers are stale. Better route: retune every map with the skirmish editor's new Auto-tune against a new player's likely deck at each fight, as was done for Thistle Fields, Pebble Beach and the Grotto on 2026-10-09.
  - Retune all maps with the new tools
  - Only the walls and trivial fights
  - Leave as is
- **Default:** Retune all maps with the new tools
- **Outcome:** Taken as default on 'continue' (revertible): tools/retune_all.js retuned 85 of 96 fights against a new player's likely deck; 11 kept as they were; HP floors 14/25/30 for skirmish/elite/boss; raid bosses untouched. Before → after table in docs/balance/retune-all.json. Still too easy after the retune: Sunken Hollow (needs stronger cards than its map has) and 3-2.

**B3. Enemy deck level reads 0 on most nodes** · Decide · Balance · asked 2026-10-09 · decided 2026-10-09
- The Enemy deck Lv is rarity × (1 + card level) − 1 per card. Enemy cards are all level 0 and mostly Common or unrated, so nearly every node reads 0, and it ignores castle HP. Tried weighing unrated cards by their power (2026-10-09): most nodes still read 0 and the numbers jumped about (Map 2's boss 0, a Map 4 skirmish 4), so it wasn't shipped. Options: give enemy cards levels that rise map by map (also makes later maps harder); fill in rarities on all cards; or base the badge on simulated win rate instead.
  - Enemy card levels rise by map
  - Rarity pass on all cards
  - Badge from simulated win rate
  - Leave as is
- **Default:** Badge from simulated win rate
- **Outcome:** Mostly resolved by B5: every card now has a rarity, so the enemy deck level is no longer 0 everywhere.

**T10. New Unique cards can break the raid ghost generator** · Note · Tech · asked 2026-10-09
- Making the Wandering Traveller Unique left stage-5 ghost decks under 20 cards, so it was reverted. The generator needs a fallback before more Unique cards are added.
  - Fix the generator next
  - Later
- **Default:** Fix the generator next
- **Outcome:** Fixed 2026-10-09: ghost decks widen to nearby cards when the band runs out of copies; tests/ghost-unique.js marks every third card Unique and checks all stages.

**B5. Rarity pass and stat fixes from the balance report** · Decide · Balance · asked 2026-10-09 · decided 2026-10-09
- card-balance-2026-10-09.md: 199 of 288 cards have no rarity; giving each one the rarity its measured strength suggests would also fix the enemy deck Lv badge (B3). 64 rated cards are outside their rarity's band, each with a one-stat fix (e.g. Chipmunk Cavalry 4→3 Attack, Raccoon Nightcrew 5→8 Attack). Many free cards measure as Legendary-strong: make them rarer, or weaker.
  - Rarity pass, then stat fixes
  - Rarity pass only
  - Stat fixes only
  - Leave as is
- **Default:** Rarity pass, then stat fixes
- **Outcome:** Taken as default on 'continue' (revertible): the 199 unrated cards got a rarity from measured strength, capped at Rare for now (114 Common, 11 Uncommon, 74 Rare), and 39 extreme outliers moved half-way toward their suggested stat (e.g. Feral Tomcat 3/5 → 3/3, Honey Badger Fury 5 → 3 Attack, Raccoon Nightcrew 5 → 7 Attack). Cards in band: 124 → 162 of 288. Walls, 3+ cost cards (B4) and the Wandering Traveller were left alone.
